# Version History – Pediatric Hand Prosthesis

This document tracks the development milestones of the prosthetic design.

---

## v4 (Current Version) – Final Prototype
**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** Functional and tested  
**Key Features:**
- Custom string tensioning clamp for one-handed operation
- Dyneema® cords for low-friction, high-durability performance
- Latex grip surfaces for improved usability
- Joints printed from softer TPU 

---

## v3 – Grip Optimization & Cable Routing  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Status:** Prototype  
**Changes:**
- Added grip surface testing (TPU, latex, hot glue)
- Settled on uniform scaling to keep wire channels functional
- Initial user feedback integrated
- Tuned in prinitng settings for optimal joint strength

---

## v2 – Fit & Geometry Adaptation  
**Date:** May 2025  
**Status:** Working prototype  
**Changes:**
- Scaled e-NABLE Kinetic Hand model for individual fit
- Adjusted wrist socket and gauntlet geometry
- Tested various scaling strategies (uniform vs. proportional)
- Settled on PETG and TPU for main components and Dyneema® for cords

## v1 – First Working Model (Flexy-Hand)  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Status:** Proof of concept  
**Changes:**
- Printed and assembled Gyrobot Flexy-Hand 2
- Identified issues: too large size, limited adjustability, poor grip, visible cables
- Used nylon strings → observed loss of force due to elasticity
- Basis for further research and benchmarking
