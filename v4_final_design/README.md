# v4 Final Design â€“ Quick Start Guide

This folder contains everything needed to replicate our current working version (v4) of the pediatric wrist-actuated prosthetic hand.

The design is based on the **Kinetic Hand by Mat Bowell**, maintained by the [e-NABLE community](https://enablingthefuture.org/). We've made minor but significant improvements to simplify usability, comfort, and assembly â€” particularly around the **tensioner system** and **material selection**.

---

## Required Base Files

The full set of STL files for the Kinetic Hand can be downloaded from:

ðŸ”— [Kinetic Hand on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4618922)

ðŸ‘‰ These files include all standard parts such as the palm, fingers, hinges, gauntlet, and wrist components.

We recommend downloading the latest official ZIP from Thingiverse and **replacing only the following parts with ours**.

## Custom Parts (included in this folder)

Located under `stl/custom_parts/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tensioner_v1.stl` | Our redesigned mechanical friction-based tensioner, replacing the default flexible tensioner. Enables one-handed cable adjustment with no glue or knots. |

## Materials Used

| Component      | Material | Note |
|----------------|----------|------|
| Main structure | PETG     | Durable and easy to print |
| Joints & pads  | TPU      | Flexible (Shore A ~95) |
| Tendon cords   | DyneemaÂ® (UHMwPE) | Extremely strong, low friction |

## Tensioning System

Replace the default Kinetic Hand tensioners with our friction-clamp version. Instructions:

1. Route tendon cord through the channel
2. Loop cord around central screw hole
3. Tighten screw to secure cord in place
4. To adjust tension: slightly loosen and reposition

See details in [`../optimisation/`](../optimization/04_tensor-system/)
