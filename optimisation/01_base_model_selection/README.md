# 🧩 Base Model Selection

In this section we explain our selection process of an existing prosthetic as our base model for further development. In our initial research we found several open-source designs that could be used as a starting point. With our criteria in mind — especially the preference for flexible joints over mechanical pivot joints for simplicity and printability — we narrowed it down to two well-known models:

- [**Flexy-Hand 2** by Gyrobot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:380665)  
- [**Kinetic Hand** by Mat Bowell](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4618922)

Both are distributed and maintained by the [e-NABLE community](https://enablingthefuture.org/) and come with open-source licenses, making them suitable for educational and humanitarian use.

## 🔍 Evaluation Criteria

We compared the models based on the following criteria:

- ✅ Simplicity of assembly  
- 🧩 Modularity and adjustability  
- 🧒 Suitability for children (size, safety, usability)  
- 🛠️ Maintenance and repairability  
- 🖨️ Printability on standard FDM printers  
- 📦 Availability of documentation and community support

## 🏁 Decision & Rationale

We chose the **Kinetic Hand** by Mat Bowell as the foundation for our development due to the following advantages:

- Better grip design with modular surfaces
- enclosed tendon routing
- Visually more appealing and ergonomic
- Excellent documentation and broader community adoption

While it has more parts and requires more effort during assembly, its **long-term modularity and flexibility** made it a better foundation for an individually optimized prosthesis.
