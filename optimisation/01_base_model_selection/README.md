# Base Model Selection

In this section we explain our selection process of an existing prosthetic as our base model for further development. In our initial research we found several open-source designs that could be used as a starting point. With our criteria in mind — especially the preference for flexible joints over mechanical pivot joints for simplicity and printability — we narrowed it down to two well-known models:

- [**Flexy-Hand 2** by Gyrobot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:380665)  
- [**Kinetic Hand** by Mat Bowell](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4618922)

Both are distributed and maintained by the [e-NABLE community](https://enablingthefuture.org/) and come with open-source licenses, making them suitable for educational and humanitarian use.

## Evaluation Criteria

We compared the models based on the following criteria:

- Simplicity of assembly  
- Modularity and adjustability  
- Suitability for children (size, safety, usability)  
- Maintenance and repairability  
- Printability on standard FDM printers  
- Availability of documentation and community support

| Feature                         | Flexy-Hand 2 by Gyrobot               | Kinetic Hand by Mat Bowell                   |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Joint type**                  | Flexible (printed hinges)             | Flexible (printed hinges)           |
| **Finger grip surface**        | Smooth (no texture)                   | Includes optional silicone inserts           |
| **Seilzüge (tendon routing)**  | Open, exposed routing                 | Covered routing with palm cover              |
| **Assembly complexity**        | Very low                              | Moderate (more parts, hinges are hard to assemble)          |
| **Fit customization**          | Simple scaling                        | Advanced: Hand-o-matic       |                           |
| **Documentation quality**      | Limited                               | Very good (Thingiverse + PDF manuals)        |
| **Visual appeal**              | Basic                                 | More anatomical & refined                    |
| **Tensor adjustability**       | Linear screw tensors          | Fixed TPU tensioners (limited adjustability) |
| **License & community support**| CC BY-NC-SA 4.0                 | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0                        |

## Decision & Rationale

We chose the **Kinetic Hand** by Mat Bowell as the foundation for our development due to the following advantages:

- Better grip design with modular surfaces
- enclosed tendon routing
- Visually more appealing and ergonomic
- Excellent documentation and broader community adoption

While it has more parts and requires more effort during assembly, its **long-term modularity and flexibility** made it a better foundation for an individually optimized prosthesis.
